AI-Driven Cultural Artifact Recognition App
Overview
This project is an AI-powered web application designed to recognize and classify cultural artifacts from uploaded images. The system uses deep learning algorithms to match artifacts from a dataset and returns relevant details, such as the artifact’s name, history, and significance, sourced from a CSV file (artifact.csv). The project is built using Flask as the web framework and serves as a practical application of Data Augmentation in Deep Learning for Computer Vision.

Features
✅ Image Upload & Recognition – Users can upload images of artifacts, and the system will match and classify them based on a pre-trained model.
✅ Artifact Details – Once an artifact is recognized, relevant information is fetched from a CSV file and displayed.
✅ Augmented Dataset – The dataset includes augmented images for improved classification accuracy.
✅ Multilingual Support – The system provides QR codes and labels in multiple languages for ease of access.
✅ Webcam Capture – Users can capture images via webcam directly on the website for recognition.
✅ API Endpoint – An API is available for external systems to classify artifacts by sending images.

Architecture
Flask – Web framework used to serve the application.
Machine Learning – A deep learning model (CNN or ResNet) is used for artifact recognition.
Dataset – artifact.csv contains metadata about the artifacts (name, description, etc.).
Frontend – Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with AR and webcam features.
Production Deployment – Uses Nginx & Gunicorn (Linux) or Waitress (Windows) for serving the Flask application.
Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask, Gunicorn (or Waitress for Windows)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
Database: CSV for artifact data storage
Deployment: Nginx, Gunicorn (Linux), Waitress (Windows)
Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed before running the application:

✅ Python 3.8+
✅ Flask
✅ Gunicorn (for Linux) or Waitress (for Windows)
✅ TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
✅ Nginx (for Linux server setup)

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ArtifactRecognitionApp.git  
cd ArtifactRecognitionApp  
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt  
3. Setup the Dataset
Download the dataset from Google Drive (provide link).
Place the dataset (CSV and images) in the data/ folder.
Ensure artifact.csv is correctly formatted with artifact metadata.
4. Running the Application Locally
For Flask’s built-in development server:

bash
Copy
python app.py  
Alternatively, if using Waitress:

bash
Copy
waitress-serve --port=8080 app:app  
5. Deploying to a Production Server
On Linux (with Gunicorn and Nginx):
1️⃣ Install Nginx:

bash
Copy
sudo apt-get install nginx  
2️⃣ Start the Flask app using Gunicorn:

bash
Copy
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app  
3️⃣ Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for Gunicorn (see nginx.conf).

On Windows (with Waitress):
bash
Copy
waitress-serve --port=8080 app:app  
6. Procfile for Deployment (Heroku)
Create a Procfile for Heroku deployment:

bash
Copy
web: waitress-serve --port=$PORT app:app  
Example Use Cases
📌 Cultural Artifact Classification – Upload a picture of an ancient artifact (e.g., statue, pottery) and receive detailed historical information.
📌 AR Support – Scan QR codes at museums or historical sites to get additional details in multiple languages.
📌 Webcam Integration – Capture images of artifacts using a webcam for instant recognition.

Future Enhancements
🚀 Implement additional language support for artifact recognition.
🚀 Integrate a more robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for handling larger datasets.
🚀 Improve the machine learning model with more complex architectures.
